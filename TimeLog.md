8am - 935am: researching Python and flask integration

940am - 1040am: still researching integration 

1040am - 1140am: Researching Map API's for application. OpenLayers seems like a good option but also seems complex.

1pm - 150pm: After setting up OpenLayers test application I beleive this will work for my use. Still need to look a bit more into it though.
